# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

A deep learning project that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices based on historical market data. This project demonstrates time series modeling, data preprocessing, and result visualization.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a classic and challenging machine learning problem. In this project, we:
- Fetch historical stock data using the `yfinance` library
- Preprocess data using scaling and sequencing techniques
- Build and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Predict future stock prices
- Visualize predictions against actual data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- yFinance
